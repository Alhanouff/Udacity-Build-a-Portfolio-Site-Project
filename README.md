# Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree


* Part 1: Web Foundations
* Project 2: Build a Portfolio Site
This project is a part of Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree. It is uploaded on GitHub as a separate repository for grading purposes.

I've decided not to use any framework like Bootstrap so I can practice coding with plain HTML and CSS.


After the project got reviewed and passed, I've update it a bit per review suggestions, the major difference being that instead of the flexbox, I positioned elements using the CSS Grid.
