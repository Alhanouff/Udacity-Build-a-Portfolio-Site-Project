# Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree


* Part 1: Web Foundations
* Project 2: Build a Portfolio Site
This project is a part of Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree. It is uploaded on GitHub as a separate repository for grading purposes.

I've decided not to use any framework like Bootstrap so I can practice coding with plain HTML and CSS.


The application offers the following features:

Creating a web page that is replicated for the project requirement.
Bold/Italiacs
Image Views
Technologies Used In Application:

HTML
CSS
Testing The Web Page:

In conclusion, I have learned a lot by working on this project. I am confident that I mastered HTML, as well as CSS and am able to successfully create web pages using different features.
